### Description
So this project has most of the requirements covered I think. Should be easy to use. Choices are usually labeled like [1] [2] etc. I chose to implement the rock, paper, scissors and timer services. Then my personal service is a 3n + 1 calculator which I think is pretty neat. There is some error handeling but not 100% so apologies if it breaks. If you put in an invalid number I think those errors are handled but not if you put in like a string when it expects a number. 

### Warning
I did not get to figuring out the registry party so I left the two lines you said to comment out like that so none of that works

### How to run program
So that's pretty simple. Just one terminal for 'gradle runNode' which you do first and then a second for 'gradle runClient'. And then you can also do 'gradle runClient -Pauto=1' for the brief run through of some examples. If running the normal client then it will show you when it expects a number as an input like [1] [2] etc. If it doesn't show that then it needs a string.
